	<h1>Supermicro Dual Xeon 12 bay server</h1>

	<p>
	Watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/iMyAiGfai28" target="_blank">video</a> of this item.
	</p>

	<p>
	This is a <b>like new</b> Supermicro 12 bay server using the CSE-826 <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/2U/826/SC826TQ-R800LPB" target="_blank">chassis</a> and X8DT3-LN4F <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/chassis/2U/826/SC826TQ-R800LPB" target="_blank">mainboard</a> featuring IPMI capability. Installed on the board are 2 Intel Xeon E5620 2.40GHz processors, 12GB Ram (6 x 2GB), and an 8GB SATADOM D150QV-L boot SSD mini drive. Hard drives are <b>not</b> included, however, the empty bay trays are included. Rack rails are also included. The 12 bay <a href="https://www.supermicro.com/manuals/other/BPN-SAS-826EL.pdf" target="_blank">backplane</a> is model SAS-826EL1. This connector supports drives up to 2TB at 3Gbs speeds I believe. Different backplanes can be installed as your needs require.

	Server was originally sold as a Pivot3 CloudBank. Power on time is less than 40 hours (looking at drive SMART data), and that was for testing. I installed <a href="https://www.xigmanas.com/" target="_blank">XigmaNAS</a> to confirm everything is working. This server was not put into use or production as far as I can tell. Clear plastic wrap is still on the handles and top of chassis. The system uses about 105 watts without any drives, and 230 watts fully populated. The fan speeds, after startup, are running at 540 RPM and are not too loud.
